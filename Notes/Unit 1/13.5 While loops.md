**draw()**

We have the built-in function draw() that is called repeatedly until the program is terminated. For example, the program below keeps drawing squares one by one.

If we wanted the squares to show up all at once, one option is to type out rect() twelve times, but that is tedious and unnecessary.

**While Loop**

What we can do instead is use a loop structure, which repeatedly executes a specified block of code. This process of repetition is called iteration. There are two common types of loops: while loops and for loops.

The structure of a while loop is almost identical to an if statement. The difference between the two of them is that we use the keyword while instead of if and the body is run repeatedly as long as the boolean expression is true.

In the previous example, each line is almost identical with the exception of the coordinates. What we can do is store the coordinate as a variable and repeatedly call rect(x, 0, 25) and x += 50.

Now the program will show the squares all at once. This is because the canvas doesn't get updated until after all the lines in setup() have been executed.

When we are creating our own loops, one thing to be aware of is avoiding infinite loops. These loops run indefinitely and anything that is supposed to happen after it will not run. They happen when the boolean expression is never false.

Here is an example of an infinite loop. This program will not show anything on the screen.
