**The rect() Function**

We can use rect() to draw squares and rectangles. This function needs three or four parameters: an x-value, a y-value, a width, and an optional height. If the height is excluded or the width and height are the same, it will draw a square. By default, (x, y) is the top-left vertex of the rectangle.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

  rect(130, 90, 260, 120); // rectangle
}
