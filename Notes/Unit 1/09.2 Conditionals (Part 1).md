**Conditionals**

In a conditional structure, certain blocks are run only when certain conditions are met. We use Booleans to create these conditions.

The simplest type of conditional structure is called an if statement, which use the keyword if.

An if statement uses keyword if followed by a Boolean value or Boolean expression enclosed in parenthesis, followed by a block of code enclosed in curly braces. In the block, we write the code that we want to run when the condition is met.

Here is an example of an if statement. This draws circles where the cursor is, but only when the mouse is pressed down.

Here's another example. This keeps drawing circles when we are pressing down on a key and it stops drawing them when we let go of all the keys.

If we want the opposite value of a Boolean, we can use the NOT operator, which is the exclamation mark symbol !

This is a slight modification of the first example. This draws a circle where the cursor is, but only when the mouse is NOT pressed down.

And here's a slight modification of the second example. This keeps drawing circles when we are NOT pressing down on a key and it stops drawing them when we press down any key.
