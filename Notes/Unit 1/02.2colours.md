**RGB Values**
All colours that can be displayed on a computer can be expressed using a combination of 24 zeros and ones (i.e. binary digits, a.k.a. bits). One of the most common ways of indicating a colour is to use its red-green-blue (RGB) value. An RGB value shows how to create the colour using combinations of red, green, and blue light. It is often represented as a tuple in which each number is an 8-bit integer ranging from 0 (no light) to 255 (a lot of light). Like a coordinate, a tuple is an ordered sequence of numbers surrounded by parentheses.

Here are the RGB values of common colours.

**Colour	RGB value**
Black	(0, 0, 0)
White	(255, 255, 255)
Red	(255, 0, 0)
Orange	(255, 165, 0)
Yellow	(255, 255, 0)
Green	(0, 255, 0)
Blue	(0, 0, 255)
Purple	(128, 0, 128)
Pink	(255, 192, 203)

The background() Function
We can use background() to change the colour of the canvas. If we give it one parameter between 0 and 255, the background will be a black, white, or grey colour. If we give it three parameters between 0 and 255, the background will be an RGB colour.

function setup() {
createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
background(255, 165, 0); // makes the background orange
}

**The fill() Function**
By default, the inside of a shape is white. To change the inside colour of a shape, we use the fill() function. This tells the program that the inside of all the shapes from now on will be this colour.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

    fill(255, 165, 0); // makes the inside orange
    rect(130, 90, 260, 120); // rectangle  
    ellipse(370, 190, 140, 200); // ellipse
}

The stroke() Function
By default, the outline of a shape is black. To change the outline colour of a shape, we use the stroke() function. This tells the program that the outline of all the shapes from now on will be this colour.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  
  stroke(128, 0, 128); // makes the outlines purple
  rect(130, 90, 260, 120); // rectangle
  ellipse(370, 190, 140, 200); // ellipse
}
