**Scope** refers to the places within a program where a variable can be accessed. A local variable only works in specific sections whereas a global variable works throughout the entire program. In JavaScript, variables can have:

block scope: a local variable that only works in a section enclosed in curly braces {} or the entire program
function scope: a local varible that only works inside a function
global scope: a global variable that works throughout the entire program.
A keyword is a reserved word that has a special purpose. The keyword for declaring a variable with block scope is let. When we declare a variable using let, that variable can only be used within the same block after it's declared.
