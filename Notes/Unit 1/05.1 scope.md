**Scope** refers to the places within a program where a variable can be accessed. A local variable only works in specific sections whereas a global variable works throughout the entire program. In JavaScript, variables can have:

block scope: a local variable that only works in a section enclosed in curly braces {} or the entire program
function scope: a local varible that only works inside a function
global scope: a global variable that works throughout the entire program.
A keyword is a reserved word that has a special purpose. The keyword for declaring a variable with block scope is let. When we declare a variable using let, that variable can only be used within the same block after it's declared.

If we try to use a variable before we declare it using let, the program will crash. The error message will say Reference Error.

The keyword let was added to JavaScript in 2015. Prior to that, var was used for all local variables depite it having function scope (not quite the same thing as block scope).

An interesting result of using function scope is that we can use variable before we declare them. However, this is usually undesired behaviour (if we wanted to use the variale earlier, we would just declare them earlier). If you're curious about how this works, it's because var variables are hoisted (you can look up what this means if you're interested).
