**Key Detection**

So far we've seen the built-in variable keyIsPressed used to detect whether there is currently any key being pressed down.

Here's an example from before. It keeps drawing circles when we are pressing down on a key and it stops drawing them when we let go of all the keys.

We can use keyIsDown() to check which keys are being pressed down. The keyIsDown() function takes a number represeneting a keycode and returns true if that key is currently being pressed down and false otherwise.

According to http://keycode.info, the keycode for the enter key is 13. Now we can modify the previous example so that the circle is drawn only if the enter key is being pressed.

We can use keyIsDown() within keyPressed() and keyReleased() too.
