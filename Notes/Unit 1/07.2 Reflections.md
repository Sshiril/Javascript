** Reflections **

If we want to reflect a shape, text, or image, we can use scale(). The scale() function takes a value to stretch/compress/reflect the x-axis and another value to stretch/compress/reflect the y-axis. We use a value of -1 to reflect the axis and a value of 1 to keep it the same. We can combine this with translate() to change the coordinate system to be backwards.

The example below moves the origin and changes the direction of the x-axis to create coordinate system:
