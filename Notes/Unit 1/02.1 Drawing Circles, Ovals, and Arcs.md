**The ellipse() Function**

We use ellipse() to draw circles and ellipses. Ellipses are like circles except they have a horizontal diameter and a vertical diameter. This function needs three or four parameters: an x-value, a y-value, a horizontal diameter, and an optional vertical diameter. By default, (x, y) is the center of the circle or ellipse using the coordinate system described previously.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

  ellipse(150, 270, 140); // circle
  ellipse(370, 190, 140, 200); // ellipse
}

**The arc() Function**

An arc is a curve along the circumference of a circle. We use the arc() function to draw arcs. This function needs the same four parameters as ellipse(), but it also needs two or three more: the starting point, the ending point, and an optional mode.

By default, the starting and ending points are written in radians. Radians are a unit used to measure the size of an angle, just like degrees. Radians usually aren't taught until Grade 12 Advanced Functions, so it'll be easier for us to use degrees. To use degrees instead, call angleMode(DEGREES). If we want to change it back to radians, we can call angleMode(RADIANS).

Here are a few significant points of an ellipse:

0° is the right-most point
90° or -270° is is the bottom-most point
180° is the left-most point
270° or -90° is the top-most point

There are three modes for the arc:

OPEN (the default mode, there is no line drawn from the start and end point)

CHORD (a line is drawn from the start and end point)

PIE (it looks like a pie)

If we don't specify the mode, it will default to OPEN.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

  angleMode(DEGREES);
  arc(150, 50, 100, 100, 0, 270, CHORD); // chord arc
  arc(250, 200, 100, 100, 0, 270, PIE); // pie arc
  arc(350, 350, 100, 100, 0, 270, OPEN); // open arc
}
