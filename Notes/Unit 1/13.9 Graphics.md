**Trails**
Recall that we can leave a trail of shapes by placing background() in setup() or leave no trail by placing background() in draw().

Here is sketch that has a blue circle and a green square following the mouse. Both of them leave a trail.

Here is the same program, but with background() moved to draw() so that neither shapes leave a trail.

We're going to see how we can have a sketch with one shape that leaves a trail and another one that doesn't.

**Graphics**
A graphic object in P5.js is like a canvas. So far we've been putting everything all on one canvas but we can simulate having multiple canvases by creating graphic objects. The function for creating a graphic is createGraphics(), which takes two numbers representing its width and height.

A graphic is treated like an image object, so we can put it on the main canvas using image(). We can create a graphic whenever we need a layer that has shapes leaves a trail when there are other shapes that don't leave trails. This works for both background layers and foreground layers.

Whenever we want to call a function that affects something on the canvas but we want it to affect only the graphic, we use dot notation on the name of the graphic.

Here is another variation of the examples above. The circle doesn't leave a trail and the rectangles are drawn on a graphic representing the background layer.

Here is one more variation. The rectangle doesn't leave a trail and circles are drawn on a graphic representing the foreground layer.

**Duplicating Graphics**
Suppose we want to create two copies of the same sketch side by side.

One way of doing that is to draw them separately.

Another way is to place both of them on a graphic, and display it twice in different locations. This is a much cleaner approach.

We can display as many copies of a graphic as we want.

If we want each section to be slightly different, we can make separate graphics.
