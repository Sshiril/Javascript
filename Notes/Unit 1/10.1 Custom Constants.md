**Built-in Constants**

We've come across the following built-in constants. They are built into P5.js and their values do not change while the program is running.

However, we can also make our own custom constants too. Just like custom variables, custom constants need to be declared and assigned a value.

**Custom Constants**

When we declare a constant we use the keyword const and then we give it a name. All constants have block scope, so the location we declare it in affects where we can access it.

In JavaScript, the convention is to name constants using screaming snake case, which is a variation of snake case. In snake case, all words are lower case and separated by underscores _. Snake case is used in languages like Python (which happens to be type of snake). In screaming snake case, all words are upper case and separated by underscores (imagine that the snake is screaming).

If we try to reassign the value of a constant, the console will say TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
