**Random Number Generator**

RNG stands for random number generator. In P5.js, we have a function called random() that generates pseudorandom (i.e. almost perfectly random) decimal numbers within a specified range.
For example random(50) generates a random decimal number between 0 and 49.99999999999999 (yes, there are exactly 14 decimal places).


We can use this to generate random colours. The program below has a circle following the cursor where the circle constantly changes colours.

We may not want 60 colours flashing at us every second, so now would be a good time to use the frameRate() function. We can use this to change the frame rate from 60 frames per second to another number of frames. If we put a number higher than 60, it will just treat it as 60 since that's as high as the frame rate can go.

We can also generate random locations for shapes. Here is an example of a program that continuously draws colourful circles in various locations on the canvas.

If we want to generate a random number between two values there are at last two ways we can do that.

Add to or subtract from the random number. For example, 127 + random(128) generates a random number between 127 and 255.99999999999999.

Use two parameters instead of one. For example, random(127, 256) generates a random number between 127 and 255.99999999999999.
