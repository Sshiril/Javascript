**Conditionals**

Previously we saw how to use the conditional keyword if. Another conditional keyword is else, which is used alongside if.

An else block only runs when the previous if condition was not met. We can think of it like the word "otherwise". Here is an example that draws circles when the mouse is pressed down and otherwise draws squares.

We can also have else if blocks. These run when a condition is met AND the previous if condition was not met.

This example draws different shapes depending on where the cursor is.

When we haveif, else if, and else together.

This example draws different coloured circles depending on where the cursor is. It first checks whether it's in the top-left quadrant, then if it isn't there it checks the top-right quadrant, and if it's not there it can deduce that it's in the bottom half.
