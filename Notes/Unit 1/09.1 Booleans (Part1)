**Booleans**

There are two Boolean values: true and false. Although they are words, they are not strings (there are no quotation marks around them). The word "Boolean" is named after George Boole, a logician from the 1800s.

The variables mouseIsPressed and keyIsPressed are some examples of built-in Boolean variables in P5.js.

1. mouseIsPressed is true when the mouse is currently being pressed down, and false otherwise.
2. keyIsPressed is true when any key on the keyboard is currently being pressed down, and false otherwise.
