**ARRAYS**

Suppose we want to generate a random multiple of 10 between 0 and 50.

One solution is to generate a random integer between 0 and 5, then multiply that result by 10:

Another solution is to use an array. An array is a data structure that stores a list of items. If we call random() and give it an array as a parameter, it will generate a random item from the array.

Arrays are enclosed in square brackets [] and their items are separated by commas.

We can use this idea to make circles of various sizes.
