**Using For Loops with Arrays**

We can "go through" each item in an array using a for loop by iterating on the indices.

This is useful when we need to keep track of the index of each item. Since we didn't use the indices, we could use a different strategy.

**For..of Loops**

We can also use a for...of loop to go through arrays.

This gives the same output as the example above. We can replace n with any variable name we want.

For...of loops also work on strings. By default it will go through one character at a time.
