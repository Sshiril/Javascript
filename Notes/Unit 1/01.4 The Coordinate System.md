**Screen Coordinates**
Coordinates in programming are usually different from coordinates in math.

In math, 2-dimensional coordinates can be graphed on a Cartesian Plane like this:

In computer science, we usually don't use the Cartesian plane for coordinates. Instead, the coordinate system we use looks like this:

For example, if we are referring to a specific pixel in an image, we would use this coordinate system instead of the Cartesian plane.

The coordinate (0, 0) is referred to as the origin. In P5.js, the origin is the top-left corner, not the center like in math.
