**Booleans**

There are two Boolean values: true and false. Although they are words, they are not strings (there are no quotation marks around them). The word "Boolean" is named after George Boole, a logician from the 1800s.

The variables mouseIsPressed and keyIsPressed are some examples of built-in Boolean variables in P5.js.

1. mouseIsPressed is true when the mouse is currently being pressed down, and false otherwise.
2. keyIsPressed is true when any key on the keyboard is currently being pressed down, and false otherwise.

**Boolean Expressions**

We can create Boolean expressions using various types of operators.

Comparison operators compare the magnitudes of two numbers to produce a true or false statement.

Equality operators check whether two numbers are equal or not equal to produce a true or false statement.

In JavaScript, we also have === and !== when we want to ensure that the two values belong to the same data type. For now we can stick with == and !==.

Boolean operators combine two or more Boolean expressions to produce a true or false statement. By convention, their names are written in capital letters.

**Order of Operations**

We know that the order of arithmetic operations is BEDMAS, but what about all the other operations we've seen so far?

If we do not use any brackets, this is the order from highest precedence to lowest precedence:

In general we should use brackets when we have an expression that has many operators so that we don't have to memorize the order of operations.
