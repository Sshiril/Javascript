**Keycodes**

A keycode is a number assigned to each key on the keyboard. To find the keycode for a particular key, go to http://keycode.info, press the key, and look under key.code.

When we use keycodes in a program, we should make them global constants so that our code is more easily readable. Otherwise, we might get confused over which number is which.
