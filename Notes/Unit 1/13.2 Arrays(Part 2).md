**ARRAYS**

Each item in an array is always assigned an index. The index tells us which position the item is at. The first position is index 0, the second position is index 1, the third position is index 2, and so on. The plural of index is indices or indexes.

In computer science, we often start counting at 0 instead of 1. Being "off by one" is a common phenomenon when programming.

When we want to access an item in an array, we can do that by calling the name of the array and putting the item's index in square brackets. For example:

An array is a type of object. Objects have properties (variables) and methods (functions). To access properties and methods, we use dot notation (objectName.property or objectName.method()).

We can get the number of items in an array using the length property.

We can find the index of an array using the indexOf() method.
