**Key Pressing**
If we want to detect a single key press, we can use the keyPressed() function.

The way we use the keyPressed() function is identical to mousePressed(), except we use it to detect key presses instead of mouse presses.

This example draws a circle in a random place each time a key is pressed.

If we want the circle to show up when we release a key, we can use keyReleased().

Later, we'll see how to detect specific keys.
