**Mouse Pressing**

If we want to detect a mouse press, we can use the mousePressed() function. This type of function is called an event listener or an event handler, since it gets called as soon as a particular event occurs. In this case, the event is a mouse button being pressed.

The way we use the mousePressed() function is similar to setup(), preload(), draw(). We are overriding it, so we need the keyword function and we fill in the body of the function with what we want to happen when a mouse button is pressed.

This example draws a circle in a random place each time the mouse is pressed.

For double clicking the left mouse button, there's doubleClicked().

If we want something to happen when a mouse button is released as opposed to when it's first pressed, we can use mouseReleased() instead. However, in Replit this only works for left and midde clicks, since right clicking on the canvas open a menu.

Later we'll see how to detect which mouse buttons were pressed (left, middle, or right click).
