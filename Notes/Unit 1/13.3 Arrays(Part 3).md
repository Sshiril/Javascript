**ARRAYS**

Suppose we want coloured circles to show up in a specific order. We can use an array to store the colours and their indices to access them in order.

Here is the full list of colour names that are recognized by HTML/CSS/Javascript.

The program above breaks when we reach the end of the array since index is out of range. Suppose we want to fix that setting index back to 0 when it reaches the end. One way to do that would be use a conditional statement.

**MODULO OPERATOR**

A more common approach to prevent an array index from going out of range is to use the modulo operator, %. It uses the percent sign, but it has nothing to do with percentage. The modulo operator is used to get the remainder when an integer is divided by another integer.

The modulo operator only returns integers between 0 and n-1 when we do % n on a positive integer. If we let n be the length of an array, we can ensure that the index never goes out of range.

**Modulo with negative numbers**

If we use the modulo operator on a negative integer, we get a non-positive integer (negative or 0).
