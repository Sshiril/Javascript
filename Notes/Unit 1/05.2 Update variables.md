**Updating Variables**

The values of variables can vary, hence the name vary-able. We can change the value of a custom variable at any point.

When we are updating a variable, we do not repeat let or var. We only use these keywords when we are first declaring a variable.

Notice that ellipse(x, x, 100); was called twice but since x changed values, it drew the circles in different locations.

When we update variables, we can write an expression instead of a number. For example, if we want x to be double its previous value, we can use the expression 2 * x.

The program below gives the same output as the example above.

When we run this program, we can see each circle being drawn one by one.

**Increment Operators**

Increment operators are used to change the value of a custom variable by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing from its previous value.

Let's modify the previous example using an increment operator. We can change coordinate = coordinate + 50 to coordinate += 50 and the program would do the exact same thing.
