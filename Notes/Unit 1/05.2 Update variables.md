**Updating Variables**

The values of variables can vary, hence the name vary-able. We can change the value of a custom variable at any point.

When we are updating a variable, we do not repeat let or var. We only use these keywords when we are first declaring a variable.

Notice that ellipse(x, x, 100); was called twice but since x changed values, it drew the circles in different locations.

When we update variables, we can write an expression instead of a number. For example, if we want x to be double its previous value, we can use the expression 2 * x.
