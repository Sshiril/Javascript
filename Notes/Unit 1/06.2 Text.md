**Text**

We can use strings to print text onto the canvas using the text() function. The text() function takes three parameters: the string, the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate.

Here are some other things we can do with text:

-Change the colour using fill()

-Make the font smaller or bigger using textSize()

-Change the font style using textStyle() and the following constants:
          NORMAL, ITALIC, BOLD, BOLDITALIC

Align the text using textAlign() and the following constants:
CENTER, TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT

We can also use any commercial-use font by uploading the .ttf (TrueType Font) or .otf (OpenType Font) file for it. We can use sites like Google Fonts to legally download these files.

https://fonts.google.com/



Once we download one we can drag it under Files on our Replit project. Then we load by calling loadFont() in the body of the preload() function. The preload() function is a function that we override, just likesetup() and draw(). The preload() function runs only once (right befores setup())and it is used to load external files smoothly. The setup() function isn't called until all the files in preload() are done loading. To use the font on a specific string and set the font size, we call textFont() in setup().
