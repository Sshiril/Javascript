**Line Comments**
We can annotate our code with line comments.

Line comments begin with two forward slashes // and can be placed after a line or code or on a blank line. They can provide explanations and reminders for us so that our code is easier to read and understand.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);  // Creates the canvas to be the maximum size 
}
We should use line comments throughout our programs to explain our thinking and make it easier for someone reading the code to understand what is going on.
