**The draw() Function**

draw() is a built-in function that is overridable, meaning we can choose what it does. The difference between setup() and draw() is that setup() is called before draw() and draw() is called repeatedly at a rate of â‰¤60 times per second.

To override draw(), we write the following:

function draw() {
  
}

Inside the curly braces {} we write the code we want to run repeatedly.

mouseX and mouseY
mouseX and mouseY are built-in variables that store the current coordinates of your cursor. We can use them in the draw() function to repeatedly draw shapes following the cursor.

If we want to modify it so that only one circle shows up at a time, we can move background(100); to the body of draw()

The reason this works is that the draw() function repeatedly redraws the background, which covers up the previous circle.



The reason the circle isn't flickering is that the canvas updates at the end of each cycle of draw(), so we see the changes to the screen all at once instead of one line at a time.
