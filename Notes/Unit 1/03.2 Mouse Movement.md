**The draw() Function**

draw() is a built-in function that is overridable, meaning we can choose what it does. The difference between setup() and draw() is that setup() is called before draw() and draw() is called repeatedly at a rate of â‰¤60 times per second.

To override draw(), we write the following:

function draw() {
  
}

Inside the curly braces {} we write the code we want to run repeatedly.

mouseX and mouseY
mouseX and mouseY are built-in variables that store the current coordinates of your cursor. We can use them in the draw() function to repeatedly draw shapes following the cursor.
