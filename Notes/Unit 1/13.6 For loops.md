**For Loops**

Another type of loop is a for loop. The syntax for a for loop looks different than a while loop, but it contains all the key parts:
1.a variable getting initialized
2.a boolean expression involving the variable that is repeatedly being checked
3.the variable getting updated

A for loop takes these three parts and puts them all on one line, separated by semicolons. The keyword for is used.

Here is the example of a while loop from before with the three key parts shown.

Getting the syntax correct is important. For example, putting a semicolon between the ) and the { causes the block to run exactly once and could cause scope problems.
