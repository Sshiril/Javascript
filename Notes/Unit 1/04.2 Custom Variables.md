We've come across the following built-in variables. 
They are built into P5.js.

mouseX and mouseY
pmouseX and pmouseY
windowWidth  and windowHeight
width and height

However, we can make our own custom variables too. Custom variables need to be declared (i.e. given a name) and assigned a value.


**Variable Declaration**
When we declare a custom variable, we have to give it a name. Ideally, the name is a descriptive word or a few descriptive words.

In JavaScript, the convention is to name variables using lower camel case. If the name is just one word, it is all lowercase. If the name is multiple words, the first word is all lower case and all other words are lower case except for the first letter. The idea is that the capital letters look like humps on a camel: thisIsLowerCamelCase and ThisIsUpperCamelCase. All built-in variables and functions follow this convention.

We assign a value to a custom variable by using the assignment operator =. It looks like an equal sign, but it's not checking for equality (i.e. it's not a left side vs. right side check). It takes a value and stores it into the variable.

function setup()
{
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  300=x;       //this doesn't work, the program will crash
  
  ellipse(x,x,200);
}
