**Mouse Buttons**

Recall that when we want something to happen when we do a single mouse click we use the mousePressed() or mouseReleased() functions and when we want something to happen while the mouse is being pressed down we use the Boolean variable mouseIsPressed in a conditional statement.

If we want to know which mouse button was pressed, we can use the string variable mouseButton. It stores the values of LEFT (equivalent to "left"), CENTER (equivalent to "center"), or RIGHT (equivalent to "right"), depending on which one was most recently pressed. On a trackpad, a left click is the same as a one-finger click, a right click is the same as a two-finger click, and a middle click is the same as a three-finger click.

In this example a message gets printed to the console when we press any of the mouse buttons.
