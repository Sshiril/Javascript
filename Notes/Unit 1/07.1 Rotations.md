**Rotations**

We can rotate shapes, text, and images using rotate(). It takes an angle and rotates everything after it clockwise around the origin.

The rotate() function always rotates around the origin, but if we want it to rotate around a different point, we can move the origin using translate(). The translate() function takes the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the new origin.

The effects of translate() and rotate() only last until the end of the function they are called in. If we want to call rotate() in draw() to get a continuously rotate something, we should store the angle in a variable and increment the variable.
